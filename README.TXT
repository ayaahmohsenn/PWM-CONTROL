PWM_CONTROL CODE:

what this code is doing is taking the frequency of the generated sine wave and convert it to binary to be ready for writing 
on the pins (2->9) for the other Micro-controller(Tiva C Series TM4C123G) to read it. then it works on controlling the speed
to match the reference speed.
